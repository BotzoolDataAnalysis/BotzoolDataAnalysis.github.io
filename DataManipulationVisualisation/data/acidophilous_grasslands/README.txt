Harásek M., Klinkovská K. & Chytrý M. (2023) Vegetation change in acidic dry grasslands in Moravia (Czech Republic) over three decades: slow decrease in habitat quality after grazing cessation. Applied Vegetation Science, 26, e12726. https://doi.org/10.1111/avsc.12726

The data contain plant species composition data from resurveyed vegetation plots in southwestern and central Moravia (Czech Republic). The plots were first surveyed by Milan Chytrý in 1986–1991 (“old plots”) and resurveyed by Martin Harásek, under the supervision of Milan Chytrý, in 2018–2019 (“new plots”).

Of the old plots, 86 were sampled between 26 June and 16 September and 8 in May. Their size ranged from 5 to 49 m2 (mean 33 m2). These plots were subjectively selected at different sites to document maximum variation in species composition and environmental conditions of the grasslands and heathlands studied. In each plot, all vascular plant species were recorded, and their covers were estimated using the nine-grade Braun-Blanquet scale (van der Maarel 1979). Plot locations were recorded in the form of text descriptions. Geographic coordinates of approximate location were added for each plot prior to the resurvey by the original surveyor using georeferenced aerial photographs and various information recorded in the field during the first survey, including slope, aspect and elevation. Location uncertainty (mean = 139 m) was indicated as the possible distance of the actual location from the given coordinates.

The resurvey was conducted between 4 June and 16 August. Care was taken to select the most likely location of the original plot based on the coordinates of the approximate location, the original site description, and the occurrence of the species recorded during the first survey. New plots always had the same plot size as in the original sampling. Each old plot was resurveyed using 1–3 new plots depending on the uncertainty of the location of the old plot. A total of 94 old plots were resurveyed at 47 sites with 153 new plots. Of these, 71 old plots at 32 sites were in current protected areas, while 23 old plots at 15 sites were outside protected areas. All new plots were located using GPS with a location uncertainty of approximately 5 m.

For each old plot resurveyed with more than one new plot, the most similar new plot (based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity in species composition) was selected, resulting in a dataset of 94 old and 94 new plots (“best-fit dataset”).

The header data structure follows that of the ReSurveyEurope Database (http://euroveg.org/eva-database-re-survey-europe). In addition, fields are added to indicate whether the new plot was used in the best-fit dataset (Best_fit) or the validation dataset (Validation). The information about location within or outside the protected area is given in the field Protection.

CSV files with columns separated by commas:

SW_moravia_acidgrass_species.csv contains the percentage covers of plant species in the plots, which are mid-values for cover-abundance categories of the Braun-Blanquet scale. Plant nomenclature was harmonised according to Danihelka et al. (2012).

SW_moravia_acidgrass_head.csv contains information on the number of species in each plot (number_species), the number, proportion and relative cover of threatened species (IUCN categories CR, EN, VU, NT, columns CR_NT_number, CR_NT_perc_number and CR_NT_perc_cover), alien species (alien_number, alien_perc_number, alien_perc_cover), species characteristic of dry grasslands (TH_number, TH_perc_number, TH_perc_cover), sand and rock-outcrop grasslands (TF_number, TF_perc_number, TF_perc_cover), mesotrophic grasslands (TD_number, TD_perc_number, TD_perc_cover) and herbaceous ruderal vegetation (XA_XC_number, XA_XC _perc_number, XA_XC _perc_cover) and unweighted means of Ellenberg-type indicator values for light (light), temperature (temperature), moisture (moisture), soil reaction (reaction) nutrients (nutrients) and salinity (salinity) used to test changes in these variables through time.
