Habitats of Pleistocene megaherbivores reconstructed from the frozen fauna remains
https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.04940


We coWe compiled a dataset of palaeobotanical records from frozen individuals 
of Pleistocene megaherbivores found in northern Siberia and Beringia and 
dated to the period from more than 50 kyr BP to 9 kyr BP. We also compiled a 
dataset of vegetation plots from several regions in Siberia. We analysed the 
similarity in taxonomic composition of plants between these two datasets 
using a novel method that accounts for variable taxonomic resolution in 
palaeobotanical data. 
For each frozen megaherbivore we sorted the list of habitats according to their 
similarity/ probability.  - see "results"

For most megaherbivore individuals, plant remains in their gastrointestinal 
tracts corresponded to tundra, forest and mire vegetation, while they showed 
low similarity to steppe. This pattern was relatively constant over time, 
showing no remarkable differences between the Last Glacial Maximum and the 
periods before and afterwards. This suggests that during the Upper Pleistocene, 
a mosaic of mesic and wet vegetation types such as tundra with patches of 
forests and mires was common in northern Siberia and Beringia. 
In contrast, the steppe was rare to absent in the landscape or underused by 
the megaherbivores as a pasture since they found enough food in the widespread 
mesic and wet habitats with more productive vegetation.


Metadata are separated on three sheets, so we will practice importing them 
separately and joining them into one.
Results are given as a sequence of numbers corresponding to habitats. 
We will try a bit of filtering, pivoting and joining the habitat names for selected animals.
