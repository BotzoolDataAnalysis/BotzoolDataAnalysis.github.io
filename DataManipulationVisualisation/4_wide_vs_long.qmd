title: "4 Wide vs.long format"

## 4.1 Data formats

There are two main ways how the data can be organised across rows and columns. Wide or long format. We will show you an example of spruce forest data, where we recorded plant species in several sites and at each site we also estimated their abundance, here approximated as percentage cover (higher value means that the species covered larger area of the surveyed vegetation plot, but we do not give the area itself, just value relatively to the total area, i.e. percentage of total area). The covers of species might overlap, as they grow in different heights.

**Wide format** is more conservative and used in many older packages for ecological data analysis. In our example we list all species and the colums are used to indicate their abundance at each site. This is the way you need to prepare your species matrix for ordinations in `vegan`. However, wide format has also many cons.

One of them is the size of the file. In the example above, there are abundance of given plants in each of the site. When the species is present in just one site, here *Trientalis europaea*, it is still keeping space across the whole table, where there can be hundreds or thousands of sites. The table code is then of course memory demanding.

One more point. For many ecological analyses you cannot keep the empty cells empty, since they are recognised as NAs. So you have to do another step and fill them with zeros.

Another disadvantage is that you cannot add easily new information to the listed species. If you for example want to separate species that are in a tree vegetation layer (recognised in vegetation ecology as 1), herb layer (6) and moss layer (9), you would have to add this information to the name of the species e.g. *Picea_abies_1*. Can you see a conflict with the basic principles of tidyverse?

**Long format** in contrast, is great for handling large datasets. Imagine we have more sites than those shown in the example above. In this format, we list all the species for Site1, then for Site2 etc. but we list only the species that are really present! By simple count of the rows belonging to each site you have the information about overall species richness.

We can also add any information, describing the data, such as vegetation layers, growth forms, native/alien status etc. After that we can very simply filter, summarise and calculate further statistics.

## 4.2 From long to wide

We will first start a new script for this chapter and load the libraries. Remember to keep the script tidy and to put there remarks.

```{r}
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(janitor)
```

Now, we will import the data. In the first example we will again use the `Forest understory data` from our folder: [`Link to Github folder`](https://github.com/BotzoolDataAnalysis/BotzoolDataAnalysis.github.io/tree/main/DataManipulationVisualisation/data) However, this time we will upload the species data saved in a long format and we will prepare a matrix in a wide format, so that it can be used in specific ecological analyses e.g. in `vegan`.

```{r}
spe <- read_excel("data/forest_understory/Axmanova-Forest-spe.xlsx")
tibble(spe)
```

We can see that there are plant species names sorted by RELEVE_NR, where each number indicates a vegetation record from one specific site (can be also called vegetation plot or sample). We will rename this name to make it easier for us as PlotID. Further we may need to change the species names to be in the compact format, without any spaces, just underscores. For this we will use **mutate** function with **str_replace** (for string specification) indicating that each space should be changed to underscore and we will directly apply it to the original column.

```{r}
spe %>% 
  rename(PlotID= RELEVE_NR)%>%
  mutate(Species = str_replace_all(Species, " ", "_"))
```

\*If you want to play a bit, you can create new column (e.g. SpeciesNew) to see both the original name and changed name.

```{r}
spe %>% 
  rename(PlotID= RELEVE_NR)%>%
  mutate(SpeciesNew = str_replace_all(Species, " ", "_"))
```

Note that in the same way as above you can change different patterns, e.g. removing part of the strings. There are even more complex things we can do, but we will keep it for later as it requires some knowledge of `regex` rules. Here I created a new column where I removed indication that the species belongs to a complex, i.e.the part of the string saying it is an aggregate, I also prepared a column "check" where I compare if the new and old name are equal or not and filtered just those cases where they are not. This should show me exactly the changed rows. If I am happy with the result, I can then remove the lines with this check and I can even rewrite the original column.

```{r}
spe %>% 
  rename(PlotID= RELEVE_NR)%>%
  mutate(SpeciesNew = str_replace_all(Species, " agg.", ""))%>%
  mutate(check=(SpeciesNew==Species))%>% 
  filter(check == "FALSE") %>%
  select(PlotID, Species, SpeciesNew, check) #select only relevant to see at a first glance
```

We have the condensed name with underscores, but there are still more variables in the table. We can either remove them or merge them to be included in the final wide format. Here we will go a bit against tidy rules and add the information about the vegetation layer directly to the variable Species using **unite** function from the package `tidyr` which merges strings from two or more columns into a new one: **A+B =A_B**. Default separator is again underscore, unless you specify it differently by *sep=XX* argument.

![](images/clipboard-2085711370.png)Argument *na.rm* indicates what to do if in one of the combined columns there is no value but NA. We have set this argument to TRUE to remove the NA. If you keep it FALSE it can happen that in some data the new string will be a_NA or NA_b, or even NA_NA (see line 4 of our example).

*Remove* argument set to TRUE will remove the original columns which we used to combine the new one (in the example above you will have only z). In our case we will keep original columns for visual checking and we will use select function in the next step to remove them.

Note that function that works in an opposite direction is called `separate` or `separate_wider_delim`

```{r}
spe %>% 
  rename(PlotID= RELEVE_NR)%>%
 mutate(Species = str_replace_all(Species, " ", "_"))%>%
  unite("SpeciesLayer", Species,Layer, na.rm = TRUE, remove = FALSE) 
```

At this point we have everything we need to use it as input for the wide format table: PlotID, SpeciesLayer and values of the abundance saved as CoverPerc. One more step is to select only these or to deselect (-) those not needed.

```{r}
spe %>% 
  rename(PlotID= RELEVE_NR)%>%
  mutate(Species = str_replace_all(Species, " ", "_"))%>%
  unite("SpeciesLayer", Species,Layer, na.rm = TRUE, remove = FALSE) %>%
  select(PlotID, Species, Layer)
```

Now we can finaly use the **pivot wider** function to transform the data. We have to specify from where we are taking the names of new variables (**names_from**) and from where we should take the values which should appear in the table (**values_from**).

```{r}
spe %>% 
  rename(PlotID= RELEVE_NR)%>%
  mutate(Species = str_replace_all(Species, " ", "_"))%>%
  unite("SpeciesLayer", Species,Layer, na.rm = TRUE, remove = TRUE) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = SpeciesLayer, values_from = CoverPerc)
```

There are different combinations of species in each plot, some of them are present and some not. Since we changed the format, all species, even those not occurring in that particular site/plot have to get some values. In long format abundance or some other information is not stored for absent species, so they get NAs. Therefore, one more step is to fill the empty cells by zeros using **values_fill**. In this case we can do that, because we know that if the species was absent its abundance was exactly 0.

```{r}
spe %>% 
  rename(PlotID= RELEVE_NR)%>%
  mutate(Species = str_replace_all(Species, " ", "_"))%>%
  unite("SpeciesLayer", Species,Layer, na.rm = TRUE, remove = TRUE) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = SpeciesLayer, values_from = CoverPerc,
              values_fill = 0) -> spe_wide
```

## 4.3 From wide to long

Sometimes it is needed to transform the data from wide to long. Here we need to say which column should not be changed, which is the PlotID (**cols = -PlotID**). Alternatively would work also -1.

Than we specify what to do with the column names, how they should be saved (**names_to**). And how to call the column with values (**values_to**).

```{r}
spe_wide %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -PlotID, names_to = 'species', values_to = 'cover')
```

We need to remove the empty rows. Because we filled them before with zeros, we will first finish the transformation and then filter out the rows with cover equal to zero.

```{r}
spe_wide %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -PlotID, names_to = 'species', values_to = 'cover')%>%
  filter(!cover == 0)
```

Sometimes we have data with NAs (not zeros) here it is very useful to use argument **values_drop_na** =TRUE

```{r}
spe_wide %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -PlotID, names_to = 'species', values_to = 'cover', values_drop_na =TRUE)
```

## 4.4 Group by, count

Using **group_by** we can define how the data should be arranged into groups. Then we can proceed with asking questions about these groups. Basic function how to summarise the information, is to count the number of rows.

In the first example we are working with species list in a long format. We can easily calculate number of species in each plot/sample by counting corresponding number of rows. First you have to specify what is the grouping variable, here it would be PlotID. And then you can directly count.

```{r}
spe %>% 
  rename(PlotID= RELEVE_NR)%>%
  group_by(PlotID)%>%
  count()
```

Count returns number of rows in a new variable called n. You can directly put extra line to your code and rename it. e.g. rename(SpeciesRichness =n). Note that in this case we simply counted all the rows. But we know some woody species might be recorded in tree vegetation layer, as shrub or as a small juvenile, so we potentially calculated such species three times. We can play a bit with distinct function and remove the layer information. Is there a difference in the resulting numbers?

```{r}
spe %>% 
  distinct(PlotID= RELEVE_NR, Species)%>%
  group_by(PlotID)%>%
  count()%>%
  rename(SpeciesRichness=n)
```

Count can be used also for other cases. For example I am interested in how many rows/plots/samples in the table are assigned to vegetation types. I will upload the table with descriptive characteristics for each forest plot, named as env, which is a shortcut often used for environmental data file.

```{r}
env <- read_excel("data/forest_understory/Axmanova-Forest-env.xlsx")
tibble(env)
```

And calculate the number of plots in each forest type.

```{r}
env %>% 
  group_by(ForestTypeName)%>% 
  count() 
```

**We can even skip the group_by step** and directly specify what to count, which is very useful.

```{r}
env %>% 
  count(ForestTypeName)
```

Count can be very useful to check for duplicate rows. You can ask to count for example IDs in the file where you expect unique ID at each row and filter those results that have more occurrences than 1. In the example below, each ID was used just once, so the filter returns no rows. Such a check is important especially if you need to append another information by join functions.

```{r}
env %>% 
  count(PlotID=RELEVE_NR) %>%
  filter(n>1)
```

## 4.5 Summarise

Using **group_by** and **summarise** we can calculate e.g. mean values, or total sum of the values within the group. See more in the further reading. Here is an example of summarise for environmental data:

```{r}
env %>% 
  group_by(ForestTypeName) %>%
  summarise(meanBiomass= mean(Biomass))
```

Summarise is also very useful for species data. For example, we can calculate the total abundance, approximated as cover, of all plants in the plot/sample. Later on we can ask what is the relative share of parasites, endangered or alien species. Or we can calculate community mean of some traits, such as the mean height of the plants or their mean leaf area index. For this we would have to append new information, so we will leave it for next chapter.

```{r}
spe %>% 
  group_by(PlotID=RELEVE_NR) %>%
  summarise(totalCover= sum(CoverPerc))
```

We can also define more variables we want to summarise and more functions we want to apply. Try to find out more [`here`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise_all.html). Below is an example of iris dataset, where I decided to get minimum,mean and maximum values for sepal leaves in different species.

```{r}
glimpse(iris)
```

```{r}
iris%>% 
  group_by(Species)%>%
  summarise(across(c(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width), list(min= min, mean = mean, max = max )))
```

## 4.6 Exercises

1\. **Forest Understory Data** - download the data from the repository [`Link to Github folder`](https://github.com/BotzoolDataAnalysis/BotzoolDataAnalysis.github.io/tree/main/DataManipulationVisualisation/data)and save it into your project folder. This dataset is used above in the chapter, please use it to prepare your own script with remarks, copy and train what is described above. Note that you will use species data in long format: `Axmanova-Forest-spe.xlsx`, and environmental data `Axmanova-Forest-env.xlsx`

2\. Use **Spruce forest data** used in the graphical example in the beginning of this chapter. *2a,* Import `spruce_forestWIDE.xlsx` \> transform *wide to long* format \> keep only true presences \> calculate species richness for each site (count of number of species). *2b,* Import also `spruce_forestLONG.xlsx` \> and transform *long to wide* format.

3\. Train transformation of *wide to long* with another dataset **Acidophilous grasslands** namely the species file called `SW_moravia_acidgrass_species.csv`. Import the data and check structure \> transform the format to long, remove absences. \*Use `separate_wider_delim` function to separate information about species name and layer into two variables.

4\. Work with dataset **Lepidoptera**, namely `spe_matrix_MSvejnoha`, which is the species file with counts of moths in forest steppe localities. Import the data and check the structure \> transform to long format \> count number of individuals at each site \> create barplot to visualise the differences (ggplot2, geom_col). \*for comparison you can calculate the number of species (unique names) and visualise this as well.

5\. Use **Forest understory environmental data** `Axmanova-Forest-env.xlsx`\> prepare a new variable which will combine Forest type code and name (unite) \> calculate mean values of biomass for these forest types (group_by, summarise) \> prepare a graph with boxplots of forest type and biomass (ggplot2, geom_boxplot). \*you can also play more with the data, calculate min, mean and max values for biomass and soil pH at once.

6\. We will use the **iris dataset** integrated in R. Use glimpse(iris) to check the structure \> if needed change the format to tibble using `as_tibble` function (iris.data\<- iris %\>% as_tibble()) \> calculate median values for selected parameters within different iris species.

7\. “*Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.*” Hadley Wickham Import `Example4` from the **Messy data** and try to find duplicate rows.

8\. \* Import `Example2` from the Messy data and try to make the data tidy with the use of `separate` function. This works in an opposite direction to `unite`.
