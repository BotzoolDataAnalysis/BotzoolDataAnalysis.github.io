version control and GitHub

easy: how to find, download code from someone without an account (examples - maps course, published codes for articles)

but much more is possible when you create your own account:

install git

create your own GitHub account

setup connection with RStudio

create your first repository (e.g. for your scripts from this course)

settings - private repositories, colaborators

code, readme, issues etc.

commit, push, pull

branches, pull request

merge conflicts

publication in a long-term repository - connection with Zenodo

GitHub pages - our study materials, personal webpages (add examples)
